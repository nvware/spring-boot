**Spring Boot** is a popular Java-based framework for building web applications. It was initially released in 2014 by the Spring team at Pivotal, which was later acquired by VMware.

Spring Boot was designed to simplify the process of creating and deploying web applications by providing a set of conventions and defaults out of the box. It is built on top of the Spring Framework and leverages many of its features, such as dependency injection and inversion of control.

One of the key features of Spring Boot is its ability to auto-configure many aspects of an application based on sensible defaults and classpath scanning. This means that developers can get up and running quickly without having to spend a lot of time on configuration.

Since its release, Spring Boot has gained widespread popularity and has become the de facto standard for building Java web applications. It has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and provide support to others.

Overall, Spring Boot has played a significant role in simplifying the process of building web applications in Java and has helped to make the language more accessible to developers of all skill levels.
